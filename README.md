# Parse Phones

Extract phone numbers from a text

## TODO

- Extract country codes

- Fix the (800) bug (see FIXME in tests)

## Notes

Detecting the country is not a simple task. For instance, some people forget
to put the indicator, or the +, or a symbol (eg. [33] or (33))
So we cannot really do magic here..
